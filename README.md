Please find the requirement for the react machine test.

TODO: 
[ ] UserContext
[ ] 
 

Create a react app with following features. As you don't need to create any backend you can use this fake JSON api for

getting data https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. For all the api related information you can refer that website except the authentication

which you should implement as a static one.

 

Candidate should follow:

========================

1. Create new project with typescript

2. Create application folder as standard coding structure

3. Write proper commands for all functions

4. Write appropriate naming conversions for creating scenes/pages/folders

5. For state use class component and statless use functional component

 

Scope:

======

1. Static login system which allows only authenticated users to access all other routes.( username: admin, password: admin@123)

2. Post listing page with search option as well as filter by user at the top as well as pagination.

3. Detail page of the post with its comments.

4. Static logout mechanism

 

Completed code can be pushed to your public GitHub repository and you can share the link as an email.

 

For design you can use Bootstrap or Bulma.

 

Feel free to get back to me if you need further clarification.
